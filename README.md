## Image Classifier Project
## Project Overview
This project implements an image classifier using deep learning techniques with PyTorch. The classifier is trained on a flower dataset and is designed to predict the class of a flower based on input images. The project consists of two main parts: developing the classifier in a Jupyter notebook and converting it into a command-line application.

## Project Structure

## Part 1: Development Notebook
In this part, a Jupyter notebook is utilized to build and train a deep neural network on the flower dataset. The notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model architecture definition
- Training and validation processes
- Saving the trained model as a checkpoint

The notebook is designed to be interactive, allowing for experimentation with different architectures and hyperparameters.

## Part 2: Command Line Application
The second part of the project converts the trained model into a command-line application, consisting of two main scripts:
1. **train.py**: 
   - Trains a new network on the dataset and saves the model as a checkpoint.
   - Supports various command-line options for customization, including architecture selection, hyperparameter tuning, and GPU usage.
## Technologies Used
Python, PyTorch
